My name is Bennett [aka the 90th most popular name in the US in 2021](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/). I am a full-time Program Manager at SAS, and part-time student in the Masters program. Some fun facts about me:

* I love Pepsi. Like a lot.
* I love cats, too. A _whole_ lot.
* I was voted most likely to climb Mt. Everest in high school. I don't think that's ever happening, though.
