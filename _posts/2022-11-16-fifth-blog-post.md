## Assignment Blog #5 - The End of an Era (until January, anyway)

This semester definitely flew by, and while I'm grateful because Spring is my final semester, I'm sad because this was probably the most groundbreaking course I've taken thus far. I went into this class not expecting to learn anything substancial that I didn't alreay know about R, and was I glad to be proven wrong! I'd never been exposed to APIs, git, `tidyverse`, or `Shiny`, and I'm estatic to have these resources in my toolkit now.

Since this is also the last class I'll have with you in this program, I also want to thank you, Dr. Post. I'm sure you've seen my name _enough_ the past couple of semesters, and I don't know what it is, but you make learning statistics so much fun. I've been challenged, inspired, and engaged by your lectures and assignments, and this course was just the cherry on top. You rock! :D

_**What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**_

To name a few...
1. **Make much better use of libraries outside of `base` R**. I would almost always only use libraries to get access to specific functions, but do all of my data manipulation and summarizing using R's innate functionality. Yeah, never again. `tidyverse` is _so_ much more intuitive, and it's helped me get a grasp on `ggplot2` that I've never had before. 
2. **Use projects for tasks that require dedicated files and global environment space.** I'm a bad R user, I know. I never used projects before this course! I never thought it mattered, and would always have to deal with clearing the global environment every time I needed to do something new, even if I wasn't done with what was there. Now I know better. :)
3. **Use R Markdown (HTML/git) and Shiny for reports**. Gone are my days of taking screenshots to inject into LaTeX or PowerPoint, or SAS-forbid generating _PDFs_ (it has its uses, for sure, but not usually how I'm sharing project results/information). Making an interactive site, report, or dashboard is obviously the way to go for my needs! With github available to host projects for free too? The world is my oyster!

_**Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?**_

So, I'm a program manager at SAS--particularly for our employee inclusion groups; diversity & inclusion is my bread and butter. Why did I pursue a Master in Statistics when I'm in HR? Well for one, I forgot what I learned in undergrad and wanted a refresher (don't tell my former professors; I'd been out of school for two years!). But also so I can drive meaningful change within our organization doing what I love and what I do best: good ol' fashion data analysis! By keeping tabs on what's important to employees and what our population demographics are, we can create solutions for maximizing talent attraction and, more critically, retention.
