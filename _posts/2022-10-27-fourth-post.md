## Assignment Blog #4 - Variable Selection

**_Write up a brief discussion of how you would plan to determine variables to use in a regression model._**

When determining which variables from a data set to use in a regression model, I first consider the following:
- Redundancy - Does more than one variable explain the same (or similar) phenomenon in the response?
- Collinearity - Do any predictor variables have a significant association with or influence on any others? 
- Transformation - Do any of the predictor variables have a non-linear relationship with the response?

To answer these questions, I would perform an EDA!

**_What variable selection techniques do you prefer and why?_**
