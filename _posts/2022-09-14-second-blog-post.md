## Assignment Blog #2 - Project 1 Reflection

The purpose of the project was--in my opinion--to apply our knowledge of data manipulation using the `tidyverse` libraries, getting further acquainted with the capabilities of R Markdown, and practicing writing functions. Overall, it was a very fun project (Dr. Post never misses)! It was especially exhilarating when I knit the whole report and everything worked seamlessly. That is a free source of serotonin.

This is far from my first "rodeo" with R, so I can't say there is much about the language itself that I learned that I didn't already have exposure to, however, this was an invaluable experience to get to know `tidyverse`. I am now obsessed with it, and will never go back to more manual methods for data manipulation ever again.

I feel like what I learned had more to do with personal competencies. For example, on projects and assignments I'm usually hesistant to use methods that I know (from previous classes or self-learning) but haven't been covered in the current material, per se. For this project I let go of that inhibitation because:

1. We are rather far removed from undergraduate studies, and
2. If I meet the requirements, who says I can't go beyond the material if I know how?

What I would do differently is code and test in a R script file before I add the code to the Markdown file. I ended up having to do that for some of the function definitions anyway, but it would've made my life easier if I had all of the data and variables in my environment... What I actually did was make dummy variables and data as I went along, which took up a lot more time than it needed to. Belatedly, I realized I could've just copied everything I had in the Markdown, but I was more focused on making things work and trying to wrap my head around what was being asked in the instructions.

Regardless, here is the [final product]([url](https://bmcauley.github.io/project1_benne.html))!
