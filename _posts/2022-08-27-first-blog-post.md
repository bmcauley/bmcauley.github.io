##  Assignment Blog #1 - Data Scientists vs Statisticians

_**What do you think being a data scientist is about?**_

I think being a data scientist is about being proficient enough in statistical knowledge to apply analysis to a business problem on a project-by-project basis. A data scientist may not be able to tell you anything about non-parametric statistics (I couldn't either), but they _can_ write a script to generate population samples using bootstrap methods. At its core, I feel like data science is just that--a study of data. A data scientist can "massage" data and mold it into something useful/meaningful for human consumption, usually to answer a question.

_**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**_

To be a strong data scientist, I see statistical and data-driven programming as a must-have skill--whether it be in R, SAS, Python, and/or SQL. No matter the actual job title or description, any combination of these languages always shows up on postings. For knowledge, a data scientist would need to know basic statistics concepts including, but not limited to:
* Descriptive stats
* Distributions
* Probability
* Variance and bias
* Correlation
* Hypothesis testing

All of this is important for them to understand how the data is structured, what models or alogrithms would be appropriate to use, and how to translate the findings for project stakeholders. Further, a data scientist should know how to handle data at any volume. This will bolster their performance in their major duties, which I see as the following:
* Translating business needs into research questions, and then into actionable solutions
* Sourcing the data through appropriate pipelines (depending on whether big data is involved)
* Data exploration and preparation/cleansing (my favorite part, honestly)
* Building, adapting, and/or improving models to apply to the data

_**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**_

When I think of a data scientist, I think industry. When I think statistics, I think academia. I see data science as applied knowledge and statistics as theoretical knowledge. One can't deny, however, that without statistics, data science would not exist; it's applied statistics done on computers, if you want to be crude about it. So, where they overlap are the branches of mathematics (_looking at you, in particular, calculus and linear algebra -- real MVPs_) used to build them into distinct disiplines over time. The use of R and SAS also seem to be common between them. Contrary to the name, though, data scientists feel more like engineers to me and statisticians are the scientists. Scientists create or discover problems to solve and engineers solve them.

_**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**_

I consider myself more of a data scientist than a statistician, but only slightly. I like programming to accomplish a task, but don't ask me to write anything for deployment! I love statistics (it'd be weird getting a Master's in it if I didn't), but I still don't understand order statistics and I probably never will. I have accepted this fate because it's not likely I'll run across it on the job, anyway.
